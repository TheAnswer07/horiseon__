​
### The challenge
​
The objective of this challenge is to work with someone else's code (Scout Rule), which recommends to always leave the code a little cleaner than how it initially was making sure that all links are functioning correctly, reworking the CSS file to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
​
### User Story
​
•	AS A marketing agency
•	I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
•	SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

​
### Acceptance Criteria
​
•	GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
•	WHEN I view the source code
•	THEN I find semantic HTML elements
•	WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
•	THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
•	WHEN I view the image elements
•	THEN I find accessible alt attributes
•	WHEN I view the heading attributes
•	THEN they fall in sequential order
•	WHEN I view the title element
•	THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
